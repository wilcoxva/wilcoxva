### Welcome to my page! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Virginia!

I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer who is passionate about the code I write and have the ambition to quickly develop the technical skills required to solve real-world problems.  A highly motivated self-starter, I want to make valuable contributions to my team from day 1.  I am an engaged learner who wants to expand my knowledge and find solutions to challenging problems.  I would love to work in a fun environment where I can form real relationships with other professionals.  I am a problem-solver, able to make sound, complex decisions in a fast-paced, technical environment.  And I am a self-learner who gets things done with minimal supervision.
