### Welcome to my page! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Virginia!

I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer who is passionate about the code I write and have the ambition to quickly develop the technical skills required to solve real-world problems. A highly motivated self-starter, I want to make valuable contributions to my team from day 1. I am an engaged learner who wants to expand my knowledge and find solutions to challenging problems. I would love to work in a fun environment where I can form real relationships with other professionals. Mostly, I want to have a strong sense of belonging at a growing startup.

With strong programming skills, I am able to write modular, testable, and maintainable code. I am a problem-solver, able to make sound, complex decisions in a fast-paced, technical environment. While I am a Full Stack Developer, I excel at React.js. I am a self-learner who gets things done with minimal supervision.
