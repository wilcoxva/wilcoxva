Hi, I'm Virginia!

I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer who is passionate about the code I write and the team I'm on.  A highly motivated self-starter, I make valuable contributions to my team from day 1.  I am a humble team player and love working in an environment where I can form relationships with other professionals.  I am a problem-solver and make sound decisions in a fast-paced, technical environment.  

I love working with Elixir.  As I continue to grow in my career, I am looking for opportunities to continue programming in Elixir while also learning mobile development.
